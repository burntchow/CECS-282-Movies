# CECS-282-Movies
## Project 3

Movie array of pointers, populated with some of my favorite movies.
The program itself can:
* Sort by name
* Sort by run time 
* Sort by IMDB rating
* Sort by release date
* Sort by main actor (alphabetically) 
* Exit 

Since we can sort by release date I will be using the myDate.cpp and myDate.h from the Calendar project 2 previously.
